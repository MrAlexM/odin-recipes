    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple but delicious desert, another British Staple. One of my go to meals when I don't have much time and I want something easy to make and equally filling.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>650g Bramley cooking apples, peeled, cored and diced into small chunks</li>
          <li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
          <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
          <li>110g self-raising flour</li>
          <li>40g demerara sugar, plus 1 tbsp for sprinkling</li>
          <li>40g cold salted butter, diced</li>
          <li>2 tbsp rolled oats</li>
          <li>custard, cream or ice cream to serve</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Heat oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C.</p></li>
          <li><p>Place the Bramley apples, caster sugar, vanilla and 1½ tbsp of water in a saucepan and gently cook for a few minutes until the apples have softened. 
          Taste and add a little more sugar if needed, depending on how tart the apples are. Transfer to a greased ovenproof dish.</p></li>
          <li><p>Place the flour, demerara sugar and butter into a mixing bowl and rub with your fingertips until it resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in the oats. 
          Scatter onto the apples and then sprinkle the extra sugar on top. Bake for 40-45 mins until golden and bubbling. Serve with custard, cream or ice cream.</p></li>
